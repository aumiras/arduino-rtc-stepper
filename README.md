# arduino-rtc-stepper
Arduino project to control the stepper motor (currently 28BYJ-48 5V DC) with RTC DS3231. 
It has to be power efficient, so there has to be included powersaving functionality.
<hr>
Stepper motor control is acomplished with EasyDriver. The base of the code is taken from Sigurd Gran-Jansen introduction (December 5, 2014).

Power saving technique is taken from Ab Kurk nice explanation and sample code (February 7, 2018).
